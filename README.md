# MUSE: Multi-PDF Information Retrieval Chat App ðŸš€

MUSE (Multi-PDF Information Retrieval Chat App) is an advanced application designed to efficiently extract and retrieve information from multiple PDF documents through an intuitive chat interface.

## Key Features

- **Multi-PDF Support**: Seamlessly process and analyze multiple PDF documents simultaneously.
- **Chat Interface**: User-friendly conversational interface for querying document content.
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Leveraging cutting-edge Natural Language Processing for enhanced information retrieval.

## Technologies Used

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and extracts key entities such as people, locations, and organizations from the text.
- **OLLAMA**: Employed for targeted information retrieval, focusing on the most relevant passages within the PDFs.
- **LLAMA3**: Utilizes advanced language understanding for accurate question answering.

## Performance

- Achieved an 8% accuracy improvement through the integration of Named Entity Recognition.

## Potential Applications

- Beyond simple question answering, MUSE allows users to target specific entities within PDFs, opening up a wide range of potential use cases in research, academia, and business intelligence.

## Future Development

We're constantly working to improve MUSE and expand its capabilities. Future updates may include:

- Support for additional file formats
- Enhanced entity relationship mapping
- Integration with external knowledge bases
